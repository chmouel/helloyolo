Download comics from hello-comics

You just provide a hellocomic URL and it will download them and generate zip
files sorted in ~/Documents/Comics/comic-name/comic-episode.cbz

Future feature would hopefully will include tracking and updating

INSTALL
-------

Just do a :

$ go get -u github.com/chmouel/helloyolo

and the binary should go to GOPATH/bin, just rerun it to get it updated.

you can as well just use the Makefile which would output to _output/ directory
